The Project Tracker system is a web-based application developed using the Django framework. Its primary purpose is to help users create, manage, and monitor projects in an organized and efficient way.

The system allows users to track project details, view project information, and manage project records through a clean and user-friendly interface. It is designed to improve productivity by providing a centralized platform for handling multiple projects.

The backend of the system is built with Django and uses SQLite as the database for storing project data. The application follows a structured MVC (Model-View-Template) architecture, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

The Project Tracker has been successfully deployed on the Render cloud platform, making it accessible online through a public URL. This deployment demonstrates real-world implementation, including version control with GitHub and production-ready configuration.

Overall, the system serves as a practical solution for project management while also demonstrating core concepts of web development, database design, and system deployment.
